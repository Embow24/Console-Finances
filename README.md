# Console-Finances

# Description
This project uses HTML and JavaScript to display the analysis of a companies financial data in the webpages console. JavaScript code was created to console log the number of months in the data, the net profit, the average change and the greatest increase and decrease in profit or loss over the period. Throughout this project multiple coding skills in JavaScript were developed including how to use for loops to add numbers in an array, how to round to the nearest 100th and how to use the numeric sort function to find the greatest differences in an array.
